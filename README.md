# Workshop - Let your tests drive your development

This [in2it workshop](https://www.in2it.be/training-courses/phpunit-workshop/) teaches the basics behind test-driven development (TDD) for PHP projects.

## Introduction

Test-driven Development (TDD) is still a subject all developers agree is a great thing, but never get around to actually doing it for many reasons. In this workshop, I use real-world business requirements on legacy code for which we need to fix bugs and add features, but we’re doing it in a TDD way.

We start off with a simple project that we're going to write from scratch using TDD, just to get a feeling what TDD is all about and to flex our fingers writing unit tests. Once we're done, we're looking at a legacy application that contains bugs and requires some features to be added. That will be the main project during this workshop.

When fixing bugs, you need to analyse the bug carefully and write a test first to determine the bug is genuine. Once you have confirmed the bug is real, you can start fixing the bug and re-run your test(s) to confirm the bug no longer exists.

When adding features, you need to write tests in accordance to the requirements. Once you've written your tests, you can start converting your tests into code and re-run your tests to confirm you have completed the process.

## Requirements

The projects used in this workshop are written in [PHP](https://secure.php.net) and we're using [PHPUnit](https://www.phpunit.de) to test these projects. In order to follow along and participate in the exercises, please make sure you have a device that can run PHP natively or in a VM. It should have the following software versions as a minimum:

- PHP 7.1.x (latest version preferably)
- PHPUnit 6.1
- GIT 2

Additionally it would be advisable that you have a free USB slot on your device. The project source code will be made available from a USB thumb drive.
